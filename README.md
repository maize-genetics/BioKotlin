BioKotlin supports nucleotide and 
protein sequence manipulation, fast sequence IO, alignment, motif, pathway support.  

BioKotlin leverages the performance and type safety of the JVM languages with ease of Python like scripting.
Because the Kotlin language is compiled, it can be thousands of times faster for
certain applications than scripting languages.  Because it uses the JVM, we expect high interoperability with
[GATK](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us), SamTools [HTSJDK](https://samtools.github.io/htsjdk/), 
BioJava, [TASSEL](https://www.maizegenetics.net/tassel) for GWAS and Genome Wide Prediction, and the PHG - the 
pangenome representation.  Additionally, since we have mimicked the beautiful API of [BioPython](https://biopython.org), 
we expect fast and efficient interoperability with BioPython through GraalVM.
