**Funcalog** - an ortholog whose protein has the same biochemical function and regulation, 
i.e. catalyzing the same reaction, in vitro binds the same proteins, can be phosporylated by the same kinases.
No subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization of the protein itself.  The gene could be subfunctionalized 
or neofunctionalized.
